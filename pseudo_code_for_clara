Clara:

Inputs:
	x, the matrix to be clustered
	k, the number of clusters to be formed
	sample_size, the size of samples to run PAM on
	iterations, the number of times to run PAM (to reduce sample bias)

Algorithm:

	iterations times:
		select sample_size random objects from x
		run PAM on the selected objects, k = k
		Add all non-selected objects from x to the closest medoid in the selected sample
	retain only the result with the lowest cost
		(cost is measured in average distance for each object from its medoid)

Since this uses PAM as a subroutine, here's the definition for PAM:

Inputs:
	x, the matrix to be clustered
	k, the number of clusters to be formed

Algorithm:

	Select k random points as medoids from x
	Associate each data point that isn't a medoid to the closest medoid
	Until no swaps are made:
		For every non-medoid o:
			Swap o with it's medoid m
			Recompute the cost of the configuration
		Retain the configuration with the lowest cost
